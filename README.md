- Design Patterns:
  - Singleton Pattern: Used for connecting to the database.
  - Service Layer Pattern: Encapsulates business logic into reusable service classes.
  - Middleware Pattern: Handles request processing and routing.

## Features

- **Data Validation:** Models are used for data validation to ensure data integrity and handle errors effectively.
- **Error Handling:** The server implements robust error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages and responses.
- **Deployment:** The server is deployed on AWS EC2 for production access.
